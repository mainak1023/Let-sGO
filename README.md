# GoLang From Scratch

<img src="/assets/favicon-gopher.png" alt="Golang Logo" width="120" />
A clean, minimal repository documenting my journey of learning Golang from the ground up. Every piece of code here is written from scratch — starting from the basics to building complete projects.

## About

This repository is my personal space to:

  * Practice and explore Golang syntax and concepts.
  * Write small programs and gradually scale to larger applications.
  * Keep my progress organized and accessible for future reference.
